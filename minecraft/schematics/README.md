## AFK Cobble Gen
Randomly made this design for the original version of The Towers back in 1.16.4, this design can be modified by changing the repeaters based on the timing of the stone generation as its server dependent.

## The Towers
A mob farm inspired by a lot of mob farms, blocks can be changed to any slabable or full block ones.

The killing/player waiting chamber can be changed to whatever design you want, but this is the design I went with.
